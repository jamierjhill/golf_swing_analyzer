# golf_swing_analyzer

This was a brainwave on the golf course. First version is just an input of a golf swing and the output has marker lines and angles and is slowed down to allow for swing analysis. The second version is a side by side comparison with no other than Scottie Scheffler. Markers, angles and lines are drawn for comparison. The side by side view seen in the link below can be paused using 1 or 2 so I can sync them up (when I run locally). Good fun to make but I doubt it will help my game. 

Next up is to do this for tennis.
